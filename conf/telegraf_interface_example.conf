# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE FOR GRNOC-STREAMING-TELEMETRY
#
# Copy this to collections.d/ without the .example suffix and update the parameters
# The file is in .toml format and behaves as such
# 
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})
#
# For additional Telegraf parameters not in this example, check out:
# https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md

  # Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.

  # By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  # timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
  #   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  #       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  # Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  # service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
